## Update and upgrade all workstations, server nodes and RasPi nodes from my homelab.
## Basically this is done by utilizing `apt`.
##
## == Prerequisites
## The `xref:AUTO-GENERATED:components/homelab/src/main/ansible-cli-sh.adoc[components/homelab/src/main/ansible-cli.sh]`
## script, which takes care of running this playbook, expects Docker to be installed. A
## local Ansible installation is not needed. When starting on a fresh system without any
## additional packages installed, start with the `* xref:AUTO-GENERATED:components/homelab/src/main/bootstrap/basics-sh.adoc[components/homelab/src/main/bootstrap/basics.sh]`
## script to make sure all requirements are met.
