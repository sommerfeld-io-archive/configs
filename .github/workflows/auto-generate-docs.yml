# @file docs-as-code.yml
# @brief Github Actions workflow that generates Asciidoc documentation based on source code from this repo and updates the projects README file.
#
# @description This GitHub Actions workflow serves the purpose of generating Asciidoc documentation
# based on the source code from the repository and updating the project's ``README.adoc`` based on
# contents from the Antora docs. It is designed to automatically trigger whenever new code is pushed
# to the remote repository. Additionally, it is scheduled to run each night to ensure the
# documentation is up-to-date.
#
# By utilizing this workflow, the project ensures that the Asciidoc documentation stays in sync with
# the latest code changes. This leads to improved documentation quality and better project
# understanding.
